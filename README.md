# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!

Hey there! I'm a freelance web developer and consultant with over 18 years of experience under my belt. These days, I'm focusing on building apps and interfaces using TypeScript and Next.JS. Besides that, I enjoy coaching teams or individuals, helping them up their game. If you need an expert hand with your projects, feel free to reach out!

But having a passion for programming in general and 18 years of work experience,
there are plenty of other languages, frameworks and tools that I use
occasionally or have used in the past. I make a point of always learning and
pushing the boundaries of my comfort zone.

I remember table layouts and spacing gifs.
