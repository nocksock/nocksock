# Hi, I'm Nils!<br>I build interfaces for the web.

Iâ€™m a Principal Technical Design Engineer focused on software architecture, design systems, and building user-first web experiences. As a freelance consultant, I help teams design frontend architectures that scale well, remain maintainable over time, and feel good to work in.
