# Hi, I'm Nils!<br>I build interfaces for the web.

I'm a senior web developer specializing in frontend development, working as a freelance consultant.

With more than 18 years of experience under my belt, I build or help building scalable and maintainable frontends from small personal portfolios websites to large and complex app interfaces.

I remember spacer.gifs, table layouts and framesets. Today I prefer working with React, TypeScript, Web Components, Next.js, Node, Hono and lately Elixir.
