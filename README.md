# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nils.

Iâ€™m a senior web developer consultant with more than 18 years of experience in web development, specialized in frontend development and currently focusing on building apps and interfaces with ~~JavaScript~~ TypeScript front to back. 
Most of my work experience is building scalable and maintainable frontends from small websites to large and complex application interfaces, usually working at the intersection of back- and frontend.

I remember spacer.gifs, table layouts and building websites using frameset.
