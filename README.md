# Hi, I'm Nils!<br>I build interfaces for the web.

I'm a senior web developer specializing in frontend development and offer the expertise  I gained in roughly 2 decades of working with the web as a freelance consultant.

With a strong foundation in software architecture and design, I focus on building scalable, sustainable, and maintainable frontends. Whether it’s for a small personal portfolios managed by a single person or large, complex applications maintained by multiple teams: I'm always trying to find the simplest solution without compromising efficiency, flexibility or pragmatism.

I’ve seen the web evolve from spacer GIFs, framesets and table layouts to the plethora of powerful tools we have today. Currently, my focus is on React, Web Components, CSS, TypeScript, Node, and Elixir to craft modern, high-performance web experiences.
